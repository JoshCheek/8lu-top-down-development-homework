Instructions
============

Your homework is to implement this DSL I wrote.

You should end up with some sort of binary that you can run which will take it as input
and generate an output of some sort. Try to do this using a top down development approach,
as I will describe in the talk.

Here are three example outputs I have generated from it:

* [Text Based](https://s3.amazonaws.com/land-of-lisp-itinerary/text-based-itinerary.txt)
* [Simple HTML](https://s3.amazonaws.com/land-of-lisp-itinerary/itinerary.html)
* [Complex HTML](https://s3.amazonaws.com/land-of-lisp-itinerary/index.html)
